TransparentLA Audit Recommendation Tracker
=============

This is a basic audit tracker that displays audit recommendations for the LA City Controller. The content would be hosted
on the Transparent LA (http://transparentla.com).

Currently, the data shown is read-only.  The tracker data is pulled from a Google Moderator account located here: http://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=20e9a5&t=20e9a5.40&f=20e9a5.6ef375

The idea is to have a platform that allows for anonymous user-generated audit recommendations.
